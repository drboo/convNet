# convNet
this project is for implementing convolutional neural network in C++ as Tensorflow style. 

In this code:
+ the weight converted from numpy to C++ arrays.
+ convolutional layers and fully connected layers by C++ function
+ soft-max normalization

Note: This code is a very naive code, it is just able to fully understand how a conv work step by step
